    "# Introduction #\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to implement the Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3) algorithm to create decision tree classifiers. Decision Trees are generally easier to understand for laymen and can be stored in simple data structures. Our goal is to create a simple means to correctly identify if a given mushroom is poisonous or edible, as well as create a readable and simple design for our ID3 algorithm so others can easily understand our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "We split our work areas into two: 'Assignment2_Final' (this document) & 'Assignment2_Exploration'. In our Exploration, we explored the data, constructed our algorithm, compared to other methods, ran tests and attempted to build a dictionary for users to easily interact with the data. Assignment2_Final (this document) is the final product which we have developed, including this report, our most recent up to date version of the ID3 algorithm and an interactive console which users can use to build ID3 Decision trees and use their own datasets if they so wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The ID3 Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree is designed using the object-oriented programming methodology. Nodes are objects of the decision tree, where each node holds references to its children. As we never traverse the tree from a leaf to the top, we don't store the reference of the parent for each node, which creates spatial efficiency in the tree compared to other ID3 algorithms. Additionally, it is not necessary to retrieve a certain node without traversing the tree beginning from the root. Therefore, we did not need to use a datastructure like an array to store all nodes, which would provide random element reading with O(1) complexity.\n",
    "However, the lookup time complexity to get a specific child of a node is important to make a fast prediction. Hence, we store all children of a node in a dictionary as a member of the node with the branch value as a key.\n",

The design of the code and command-line make it so anyone can modify the algorithm to their particular needs with ease. This is due to the object oriented design of the code and the simple, but powerful commands of the interface. Anyone can use any"
