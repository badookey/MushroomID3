    "The nodes of the decision tree are stored in an object oriented way, where each node holds references to its children. As we never traverse the tree from a leaf to the top, we don't store the reference of the parent for each node. Additionally, it is not necessary to retrieve a certain element without traversing the tree beginning from the root. Therefore we did not store the nodes in an array like structure, which would have a complexity of O(1) to lookup a specific element.\n",
